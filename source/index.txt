====================
The Cyborg Institute
====================

Welcome to the Cyborg Institute! The "Institute," somewhat in-jest, has
been an attempt at building an *ad hoc* virtual think tank in the
tradition of :term:`free software`. The Cyborg Institute has always
addressed issues at the intersection of technology, society/culture,
and the individual user.

Currently, the Institute operates as a publishing/hosting umbrella and
as a home for several projects and tools. For more extensive
information about the current projects, their state, and their goals
see the ":doc:`projects`" page. To join an existing Institute project
or contribute to an existing project, see the ":doc:`meta`" page. And
always feel free to be in :doc:`contact <contact>`."

Projects
--------

- :project:`Systems Administration for Cyborgs <administration>` (a book-like-object.)
- :project:`Taskfile <taskfile>` (a task list compiler.)
- :project:`Personal Stats Logger (stl) <stl>` (a script.)
- :project:`tychoish's desktop configuration stack <stack>` (or
