Taskfile
--------

Using `GNU Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ provides a way
to compile lists of ``TODO`` items from a tree of files, such as those
created by a flat-file wiki like `ikiwiki`_ or `Gollum`_. Includes
example makefile examples, a deployment guide, documentation, and a
development history.

``csc``, the Cyborg Site Compiler
---------------------------------

``csc`` springs from a collection of experiences with various
available static site compilers. [#static-site-compilers] optimized
for incremental builds, flexible indexing and page aggregation
features.

.. [#static-site-compilers] "Static Site Compilers" are tools that
   generate websites based on templates and source files in a
   lightweight markup language. 

stl, a Personal Logging Script
------------------------------

``stl`` (i.e. "status logger") is a tool for managing, maintaining,
and logging work for writers. It provides a unified interface around
logging word count information, as well as compiling projects, and
other related functionality. If you publish text using software such
as `ikiwiki`_, `Sphinx`_, or using ad hoc Makefiles, ``stl`` may do
exactly what you want.

Desktop Configuration Stack
---------------------------

"Stack," provides baseline configurations for a number of
applications, presented as an example and jumping off point for new
users who want to build their own configuration. Contains
extensive documentation, a collection of helpful scripts,
configuration for StumpWM, and emacs.
