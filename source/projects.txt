Using `GNU Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ provides a way
to compile lists of ``TODO`` items from a tree of files, such as those
created by a flat-file wiki like `ikiwiki`_ or `Gollum`_. Includes
example makefile examples, a deployment guide, and documentation.

``csc``, the Cyborg Site Compiler
---------------------------------

``csc`` springs from a collection of experiences with various
available static site compilers. [#static-site-compilers]_ optimized
for incremental builds, flexible indexing and page aggregation
features.

- `csc project page and documentation <http://cyborginstitute.com/projects/csc>`_
- `csc source repo <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=csc.git>`_
- `csc source repo on github <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/csc>`_

.. [#static-site-compilers] "Static Site Compilers" are tools that
   generate websites based on templates and source files in a
   lightweight markup language.

stl, a Personal Logging Script
------------------------------

``stl`` (i.e. "stats logger") is a tool for managing, maintaining,
and logging work for writers. It provides a unified interface around
logging word count information, as well as compiling projects, and
other related functionality. If you publish text using software such
as `ikiwiki`_, `Sphinx`_, or using ad hoc Makefiles, ``stl`` may do
exactly what you want.

- `stl source repo <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=stl.git>`_
- `stl source repo on github <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/stl>`_

"Stack," provides baseline configurations for a number of applications
(beginning with emacs and StumpWM,) presented as an example and
jumping off point for new users who want to build their own
configuration.
