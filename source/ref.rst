.. glossary::

   free software
      Used with preference over the term "open source," to refer to
      the group of practices that relate to sharing software and
      distributing ownership of copyright, development, and
      management. Typically the word "free" in this formulation refers
      to the "freedom" that this approach to technology provides both
      users and developers of technology, rather than the cost of the
      software licensing/distribution (which is typically "free" as
      well by virtue of basic economic pressure.)

   git
      A popular version control system developed for use by the `Linux
      Kernel <http://kernel.org>`_ project to manage source-code
      versioning and collaboration.
