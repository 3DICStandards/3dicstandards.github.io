CSC, Cyborg Site Compiler
-------------------------

``csc`` is a static site compiler in the tradition of Jekyll, Ikiwiki,
and Sphinx. In brief the goals of this project are to:

- focus on faster and more reliable incremental builds.

- focus on generalizable content generation possibilities rather than
  specific blog-like, wiki-like, or documentation-like output.

- separate site generation, data aggregation, and build system
  components into distinct stages and processes without needing to
  share substantial state.

The goal is that this system will be fast for generating sites,
particularly with large numbers of pages. The design also permits
extensible and flexibility with regards to filters and
output. Fundamentally ``csc`` will be able to handle real-world
workflows.

Basic Computing for Cyborgs
---------------------------

As a follow up to :project:`Systems Administration for Cyborgs
<cyborg-admin>`, this project will provide a basic introduction to
fundamental computing concepts that all "cyborgs" ought to understand
to obtain a functional "Literacy of Computing." The intended audience
for this project are non- and less-technical users. Topics may
include:

- Networking Design and Components
- Network Protocols and Layers
- Software Development Methods
- Application Architecture and Design
- Programming and Coding
- Infrastructure and Services
- Interfaces and Users
