Participating in the Institute
==============================

Institute projects must be relevant and applicable to the current work
and spirit of the Institute. The Institute revolves around
understanding and improving:

- the ways people interact with technology,
- how users of technology build their own technology,
- how technology shapes our lives, societies, and work.

Existing project members and leaders evaluate new projects on a
case-by-case basis, using factors that include relevance and available
resources.

See the ":doc:`contact`" page with more information on how to get in
touch with institute leaders and contributors.
